LEVEL ID SYSTEM

levId corresponds to certain lines of a game file
		 * level save file is organized as
		 * lv(number)(number) as level id, followed by two colons if the level id is single-digit, or one if it is double-digit
		 * 
		 * the first number is the row it is in
		 * 
		 * the second number is the column
		 *
		 * so lv24 would be 2 down, four to the right
		 * 
		 * there are 4 columns and five rows
		 * 
		 * then, a series of four zeroes and ones, representing doors 1-4
		 * 0 represents false, 1 represents true
		 * a " "
		 * then, a series of five zeroes and ones, representing items 1-5
		 * another " "
		 * then, a four-digit String representing the file name of the .png file for the level background
		 * 
		 * IF A NUMBER IN THE FIVE-DIGIT PORTION IS 2, THAT MEANS THE ITEM SPAWN IS RANDOM
		 * 
		 * example line: lv34:0110 11000 tech
		 * 
		 * this means the level is at grid position (3, 4)
